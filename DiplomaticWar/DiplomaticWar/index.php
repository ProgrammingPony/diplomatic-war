<h1>Under Construction</h1>
<p><b>July 5, 2014:</b> We have decided to build the game using Unity and hopefully port this into an application for all the major mobiles OSs and for browsers. The game is currently being constructed.</p>
<p>Also, mail sent from our website should no longer show up in the junk folder.</p>
<p><b>July 3, 2014:</b> The support FAQ and password reset pages have been setup. Password reset code links currently don't work so they have been disabled and will be fixed prior to beta launch. For now just copy the code provided in the email and enter it into the field.</p>
<p><b>July 1, 2014:</b> Temporary bug report page has been completed but will have more testing prior to beta release.</p>
<p><b>June 30, 2014:</b> Notice, users are able to sign up, verify and login. verification mail may be sent to your spam folder, we will handle
